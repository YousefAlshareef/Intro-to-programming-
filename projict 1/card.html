			<p>The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is one of two subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. Horses in this subspecies are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC</p>
